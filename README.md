# Intermediate-HTML-CSS-and-JavaScript-Task-02
I have successfully completed the "Intermediate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript" task with ApexPlanet. Through this project, I built a responsive contact form using HTML and CSS, implemented JavaScript form validation, created a responsive layout using Flexbox and Grid, and developed a dynamic to-do list and image gallery with DOM manipulation.
